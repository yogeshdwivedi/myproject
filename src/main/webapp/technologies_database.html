<img src="images/database.jpg" width="453" height="242" class="fright" />An organised collection of data is known as a database. Data can be of many types and should serve as a relevant piece of information. Applications that are designed to interact with users, other applications as well as the database itself are known as database management systems. These database management systems capture data and also analyse them, and can be of huge importance if analysed and introspected properly. A general purpose DBMS or a database management system allows administration of a database, as well as creation, query, update and definition of the database also. <br />
<br />
Some of the most popular and used DBMS are Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, MySQL, SyBASE among others. Generally a database is not portable across different DBMS but using standards like ODBC, JDBC and SQL DBMS can be interoperable. A single application properly programmed, can work with more than one database.
<br />
<br />
Oracle, MYSQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server are some of the best database software that is in use across the world.  Database programs also known as database applications are meant primarily for entering and retrieving data or information from a computer managed database. A DBMS that follows a relational model based on Codd’s principles are known as RDBMS or relational database management systems. RDBMS are presently being favoured over hierarchical databases and network databases for their user friendly designs and use.
<br />
