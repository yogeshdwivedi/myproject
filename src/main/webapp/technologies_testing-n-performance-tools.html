<div class="bdy-txt">
<img src="images/testing.jpg" width="453" height="302" class="fright" />There are many Testing and performing tools as well as testing and performance tools platforms that are available. Some of these are free and they may be platform-specific or even application-specific testing and performance tools. Some of these testing and performance tools platforms are open source and provides powerful frameworks as well as services for developers and programmers to design and deliver some of the most unique testing and performance tools. There are some commercial versions available too. <br />
<br />
We have some of the most talented and experienced programmers and developers who develop and design some of the most amazing testing and performance tools that can be used for multiple platforms or be specific in their use. They can also integrate them with platforms and other tools and can customise them to just fit your needs.
<br />
<br />
Our experts also use JUnit unit testing framework for Java programming language. JUnit is one of the most important aspects of development of test driven development. We also use HttpUnit which is an open source software testing framework for testing websites without web browsers. It supports a number of languages that are used to write web pages like HTML, JavaScript and so on. 
<br />
<br />
Our programmers use them in combination with JUnit for wonderful results. They also customise them for best results, and also develop other testing apps and performance testing apps using them. Described as a C++ port of JUnit, CppUnit is another Unit testing framework module for C++ programming language.
<br />
<br />
We have some of the most experienced and talented programmers in our team. They not only customise and develop some of the most exciting and demanding testing and performance tools. They also use them along with HTTP Unit, JUnit, CPPUnit and other testing tools to check the performance, stability and other aspects of any developed software. They also customise them for your use. They also deploy them for use in personal as well as public cloud among others. We also offer personalised software performance and testing tools and also other IT solutions at the most competitive prices.
<br />
<br />
<div class="bdyhead">HTTP Unit</div>
Web sites can be tested using an open source testing software known as HttpUnit; there's no need to use a web browser to test a site. HTTP Unit assist regression testing, HttpUnit, also allows automated testing of web applications. HTML form submission, cookies, automatic page redirection, HTTP basic access authentication and JavaScript are supported by Httpunit along with some other services and web processes also. HTTP Unit is also written in Java.
<br />
<br />
This allows Java test codes to process returned pages at text, container of forms, tables and links or XML DOM. In a combination with JUnit this can act as a Java HttpUnit and together can be used to write tests and customise tests that can perform proper tests regarding behaviour and other properties of a web site.
<br />
<br />
We have the most dedicated programmers and testing experts who prefer to test every area for testing the application as well as the enterprise as a whole. They ensure that they test even the simplest components, classes and all aspects of the enterprise. They also develop customised tests for Java HTTPUnits as well as other Httpunits to test even the smallest units for effective and proper behaviour.
<br />
<br />
The experts at our testing unit not only use these testing platforms for checking the effective and efficient performance of each and every individual component as well as the smallest of applications on the web page, they also ensure that they are checked for their working together with the way they are supposed to work. Known as integration tests in popular terms, they also make sure that these elements work together seamlessly in the best possible way.
<br />
<br />
Our experts also ensure that they perform load tests to check the performance of these applications and web elements under various conditions. We also test these web pages, applications for functional tests both manually and through automated processes. We test the documentation, licenses and all other aspects of the application as well as the web pages from the developer’s point of view as well as from the user’s point of view and expectation. We also offer comprehensive IT solutions for all kinds of requirements.
<br />
<br />

<div class="bdyhead">Apache JMeter</div>
With a major focus on web applications, Apache JMeter is also used as a load testing tool that analyses and measures the performance of a variety of services. Apache JMeter, as the name indicates is an Apache project. It can be used for testing a variety of applications and processes.
<br />
<br />
JMeter can be used as a unit testing tool for FTP, LDAP, JMS, HTTP, Webservices, JDBC database connections. JMeter can also be used for testing OS Native processes and also TCP connections. It can be used as a monitor when advanced monitoring solutions are needed. Variable parameterisation, Per thread cookies, configuration variables, assertions or response validations are some of the other supports of JMeter. The architecture of Jmeter is based on Plug-ins and many splendid features can be implemented using plug-ins.
<br />
<br />
Apache JMeter 2.7 was released in 2012 and has some improved and enhanced features compared to its earlier versions. The new OS sampler to sample native processes is good and there are improvements in JMS samplers, with test action samplers that can interrupt current iteration.
<br />
<br />
Reporting has been enhanced with aggregate graph improvements and better HTML reporting. There have been considerable improvement in areas of indicator of error/fatal error messages, which also facilitates faster debug of scripts. The new Apache JMeter 2.7 also has an improved mailer visualise with SSL and TLS authentication, and a new detail box for parameters.
<br />
<br />
We use Apache JMeter not only for web testing but also a number of other test functions. We use Apache JMeter 2.7 to test performances of both static and dynamic resources like files, servlets and others. Our developers and testing engineers also use them to simulate heavy load on networks, servers or the object and test the strength; they also analyse and test the performance in different load conditions and types.
<br />
<br />
We also use it to test the load and performances on different servers like HTTP, HTTPS, Mail servers and so on. We also develop some customized plug-ins for testing certain features and aspects of the application. We also offer comprehensive software testing and other related solutions.
<br />
<br />

<div class="bdyhead">JUnit</div>
A unit testing framework, JUnit is focussed on Java programming language. JUnit is one of a family of Unit testing frameworks that are collectively known as xUnit which originated with SUnit. It has been hugely important in the sphere of test driven development. JUnit test fixture is a Java object and test methods can be annoted. ‘First testing and then coding’ has been one of the ideas promoted by JUnit, and emphasis is laid in testing a little and coding a little progressively. This helps our programmers and other programmers around the world to be productive and offers stability of the program code. This also lessens debugging time and also lot of coding and searching time.
<br />
<br />
JUnit testing is done by unit test, which are small pieces of code for specific functionality in the code for testing. Simply put, unit tests in JUnit testing are codes for testing small units of code, for example a method or a class for both components as well as integration tests. They are aimed at not only testing individual components and also for their performance when integrated with other applications and sets of components. JUnit testing ensures that the codes work the way they are intended to do. They test them from the perspective of the developer and the user also.
<br />
<br />
Our expert programmers also can also customise and integrate them as plug in with ANT, ECLIPSE and some others. We also provide testing services using JUnit testing and JUnit test Suite for corporate requirements and offer comprehensive services for all IT related requirements.
<br />
<br />
